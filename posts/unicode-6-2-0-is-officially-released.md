The Unicode Consortium has released [Unicode
6.2.0](http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode6.2.0/) three days ago. This
minor release adds only one new codepoint, [U+20BA TURKISH LIRA
SIGN](https://codepoints.net/U+20BA).

Apart from that, emojis have got improved line break properties. Other
characters were also updated to enhance text segmentation.
