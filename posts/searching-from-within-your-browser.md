Did you know, that you can search codepoints directly from within your
browser? In IE and Firefox you can add the Codepoints.net search as simply as
clicking an “Add Search” button. The technology is called OpenSearch, and it
allows you to place the codepoint search in a row with Google, eBay and the
others usually pre-installed in your browser.

On [the OpenSearch
website](http://www.opensearch.org/Community/OpenSearch_search_clients) you get
detailed pointers how to use these features in your favorite client. In
Firefox, click in the upper-right search box on the small triangle and click
then ‘Add “Search Codepoints”’ to install the codepoints search.
