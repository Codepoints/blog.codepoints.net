<p>This is a buzzword-filled post to say the least. We have just published our
new REST API to Codepoints.net. See the <a
href="https://github.com/Boldewyn/Codepoints.net/wiki/API">documentation at the
Github Wiki</a>.</p>

<p>The API features JSON and JSON-P access to codepoints, sample glyphs,
blocks, planes, scripts, and so on as well as transformation and filter
functions for UTF-8 input strings.</p>

<p>A <a href="http://codepoints.net/api/v1/codepoint/0064">typical request</a>
would look like this:</p>

<pre>GET /api/v1/codepoint/0064
Host: codepoints.net</pre>

<p>with an answer giving you information about “LATIN SMALL LETTER D” to your
heart’s content:</p>

<pre>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
