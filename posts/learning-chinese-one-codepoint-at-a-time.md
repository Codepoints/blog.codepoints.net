Yesterday we started to post the 100 Chinese characters most used in
nowadays Hànyǔ as Unicode Codepoint of the Day. This series will last until
middle of April (obviously). From time to time we will add informative blog
posts here to put the characters in context. If you learn Chinese, now is a
good time to follow [@CodepointsNet](https://twitter.com/CodepointsNet) on
Twitter to get a free Chinese lesson every day.

As source we used [Patrick Zein’s
list](http://www.zein.se/patrick/3000char.html) of 3000 most frequent
characters, which is a weighted compilation of other studies. The list aims to
be “a compilation of the 3000 most frequently used characters in modern,
simplified, mainland Chinese.” So it fits the purpose of the current Codepoint
of the Month thread quite well.
