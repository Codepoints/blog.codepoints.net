Hi!

As [mentioned before](translating-codepoints-net.html) we want Codepoints.net
to be translated in as many languages as possible. For this to become true we
registered [a project at
Crowdin](https://crowdin.net/project/codepoints/invite), a collaborative
translation service.

If you are fluently speaking a non-english language and dare to dive into
Unicode nomenclature, we’d love to have you helping with translations. What’s
in for it? It’s all about the fame. You get your name posted on the “about”
page as one of the contributors to Codepoints.net.

So if you’d like to lend us your language skills, please head over to

[crowdin.net/project/codepoints/invite](https://crowdin.net/project/codepoints/invite)

and join in!
