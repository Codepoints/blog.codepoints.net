<p>Yesterday we started to post the 100 Chinese characters most used in
nowadays Hànyǔ as Unicode Codepoint of the Day. This series will last until
middle of April (obviously). From time to time we will add informative blog
posts here to put the characters in context. If you learn Chinese, now is a
good time to follow <a

free Chinese lesson every day.</p>

<p>As source we used <a href="http://www.zein.se/patrick/3000char.html">Patrick
  Zein’s list</a> of 3000 most frequent characters, which is a weighted
compilation of other studies. The list aims to be “a compilation of the 3000
most frequently used characters in modern, simplified, mainland Chinese.” So it
fits the purpose of the current Codepoint of the Month thread quite well.</p>
