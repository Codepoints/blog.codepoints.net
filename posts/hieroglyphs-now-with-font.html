<p>We have embedded George Dourosâ€™ great Aegyptus font as webfont. From now on
you can view Egyptian Hieroglyphs without installing any additional font. See
it in action here: <a href="http://codepoints.net/U+13000">U+13000 EGYPTIAN

<p>(Please keep in mind, that you might to wait for some seconds on the first
Hieroglyphs page, until the web font has downloaded.)</p>
