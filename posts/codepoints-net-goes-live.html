<p>Finally it’s time to push <a href="http://codepoints.net">Codepoints.net</a>
into existence! It’s my try to tackle the visualization of Unicode.
Codepoints.net is by far not the first to do it. Notable other sites, that
have an other focus however, are for example
<a href="http://decodeunicode.org">Decode Unicode</a> or
<a href="http://graphemica.com">Graphemica</a>.</p>

<p>We want to make finding specific characters as simple as possible. Therefore
you can either use the <a href="http://codepoints.net/search">expert search</a>
or a <a href="http://codepoints.net/wizard">wizard</a>, that asks a set of
questions to narrow down candidates. Another possibility is to <a
href="http://codepoints.net/scripts">search by script</a>, where we show
scripts distributed on the globe.</p>

<p>Codepoints.net is fully open source. If you want to contribute or just give
feedback, you’re most welcome. Get in touch via this blog, <a
href="https://twitter.com/CodepointsNet">Twitter</a> or <a
