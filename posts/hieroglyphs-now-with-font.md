title: "Hieroglyphs now with Font"
---

We have embedded George Dourosâ€™ great Aegyptus font as webfont. From now on
you can view Egyptian Hieroglyphs without installing any additional font. See
it in action here: [U+13000 EGYPTIAN HIEROGLYPH
A001](https://codepoints.net/U+13000)

(Please keep in mind, that you might to wait for some seconds on the first
Hieroglyphs page, until the web font has downloaded.)
