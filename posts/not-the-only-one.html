<p>Of course the idea of a Unicode visualization is not new. If <a
  href="http://google.com/search?q=Unicode">you google for it</a>, there are a
multitude of lists of Unicode blocks and stuff. However, the quality is
extremely mixed. While anyone can write a loop around Python’s <a
href="http://docs.python.org/library/unicodedata.html"><var>unicodedata</var></a>
library and print the result, the important informations, which Unicode
version, how does the character look usually, is it deprecated, and so on, are
seldomly found.</p> <p>I’d like to present you here some projects that have in
my opinion a high quality and can help you find your way through Unicode in
many different facettes.</p>

<h3>The <a href="http://cldr.unicode.org/unicode-utilities">Unicode Utilities</a></h3>

<p>These tools are directly on the Unicode.org website. This is a set of tools
that allow browsing Unicode characters in a lot of different ways. Most
commonly, you can simply view character definitions, but you can also search
for confusables (characters similar to a specific one), regular expression
tokens, and so on. The trustworthiness is high by nature, since the database is
curated by members of the Unicode consortium itself.</p>

<h3><a href="http://decodeunicode.org">Decode Unicode</a></h3>

<p>The site is, in its own words, “an independent online-platform for digital
type culture, developed at the Department of Design at the University of
Applied Sciences in Mainz.” It presents all of Unicode 5 in a very tidy and
stylish environment and has an attached wiki with information for many
codepoints. Its greatest advantage is, that the people behind have visualized
<em>every single one</em> of the Unicode codepoints they present.</p>

<h3><a href="http://graphemica.com">Graphemica</a></h3>

<p>(“For people who ♥ letters, numbers, punctuation, &amp;c”) It is a social
Unicode browser. That is, you can pick and share favourites, add tags and
comment on single codepoints. Unfortunately they also haven’t got support for
the new Unicode 6.0 characters.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/">FileFormat.info</a></h3>

<p>It presents all current Unicode characters up to version 6.1 together with
renderings from fonts. It shows a great lot of representations of a character
from Python escapes to mappings in other character sets.</p>

<h3><a href="http://rishida.net/utilities">Richard Ishida’s Utilities</a></h3>

<p>Richard Ishida is “the International­ization Activity Lead at the W3C (World
Wide Web Consortium) and [he] contribute[s] to the Unicode Editorial
Committee.” On his website he provides a set of tools to browse codepoints and
also to modify them, especially a very helpful tool called <a
href="http://rishida.net/scripts/uniview/">UniView</a>.</p> <p>He also authored
most of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/International/articlelist">articles the
W3C has published</a> about internationalization and Unicode. They are a
must-read for everyone only slightly concerned with this topic.</p>

<h3><a href="http://shapecatcher.com/">Shapecatcher</a>: Unicode Character Recognition</h3>

<p>If you don’t know the name of a character but its general shape, you can
search for it on Shapecatcher. Paint the shape in a box, and Shapecatcher will
compare the drawing with about 11,000 characters it has in its database,
presenting you the best matches. This works remarkably well for many character
classes.</p>
