<p>Some codepoints show a mysterious line in the “Representations” section
called “digraphs.” What does that code mean? It’s a way to enter this character
with only an easy to memorize set of ASCII letters. Many digraphs are
standardized in <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1345.html">RFC 1345</a>,
and you can use this technique in several editors and environments. The <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digraph_(computing)">Wikipedia knows the
details.</a></p>

<p>A single digraph is composed of two (or sometimes more) ASCII characters and
represents uniquely a certain Unicode codepoint. For example, the digraph AE
represents the Unicode codepoint <a href="http://codepoints.net/U+0198">U+0198
(LATIN CAPITAL LETTER AE): Æ</a>. To distinguish digraphs from regular ASCII
characters some introducing has to occur. In Vim, the famous text editor, the
Ctrl-K sequence starts the digraph entering mode.</p>

<p>You can try digraphs online at <a
  href="http://boldewyn.github.com/digraphs/demo.html">this digraphs demo
page</a>. In a short time you will become adicted to the editing power of
them.</p>

<p>There is a <a
  href="https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/digraphs/">Firefox
addon</a> to enter digraphs in your favorite browser. It is written by me, but
I must admit, that it lacks several features at the moment. In most
environments it works as advertised, but it isn’t as stable as I wished it to
be. If you happen to know some bits about Firefox addon development, please get
in touch. I’d love to hear from you how to improve the addon.</p>
