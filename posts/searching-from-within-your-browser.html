<p>Did you know, that you can search codepoints directly from within your
browser? In IE and Firefox you can add the Codepoints.net search as simply as
clicking an “Add Search” button. The technology is called OpenSearch, and it
allows you to place the codepoint search in a row with Google, eBay and the
others usually pre-installed in your browser.</p>

<p>On <a href="http://www.opensearch.org/Community/OpenSearch_search_clients">the
OpenSearch website</a> you get detailed pointers how to use these features in
your favorite client. In Firefox, click in the upper-right search box on the
small triangle and click then ‘Add “Search Codepoints”’ to install the
codepoints search.</p>
